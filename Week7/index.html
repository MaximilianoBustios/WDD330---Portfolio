            <li>An IIFE function is an anonymous function that is called as soon as it is defined. To create an IIFE function we must put parentheses at the end of the function definition.</li>
            <li>With the temp keyword, we can create temporary variables that are used just one time and then disappear.</li>
            <li>A recursive function is a function that calls itself when a condition is true.</li>
            <li>We can use promises to simplify the process of using multiple callbacks.</li>
            <li>There are functions that allow us to return other functions.</li>
            <li>The generators are special functions used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value.</li>
            <li>Using ajax we can asynchronously connect to a server. Refresh pages without the need to reload them</li>
            <li>With the Fetch API we are able to fetch the URL we are looking for and handle the responses we wish to give.</li>
            <li>With .catch we provide a response if an error occurs with the server</li>
            <li>Response has more properties, some are headers, URL, redirected, and type.</li>
