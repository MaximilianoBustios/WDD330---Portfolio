    <ul>
      <li>With "this" the methods can refer to the object</li>
      <li>"this" can be used in different contexts so we have to know how it is being used.</li>
      <li>You can replace "this" with other statements but it is important to use it and know how it works.</li>
      <li>If an object has functions inside, they are called "methods".</li>
      <li>Objects have getters and setters, these are used to get and change the values ​​of their data.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the DOM we can have elements that directly access HTML elements that contain information.</li>
      <li>With the innerHTML property, we can use HTML in the DOM.</li>
      <li>We call events all the actions that we have to carry out when the user interacts with the elements of the
        website.</li>
      <li>There are two ways to propagate an event, "capturing" and "bubbling". One acts on the element it was acted on
        and the other acts from the root element. Both can be used.</li>
      <li>The parameter of our functions should not always be called "event", it can be different.</li>
