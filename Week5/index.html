        <ul>
            <li>Stack traces help us find the source of the error</li>
            <li>If there are warnings in our code, we must correct them because even if the code continues to work, this can cause problems in its operation</li>
            <li>Writing code in strict mode helps us with clarity and speed</li>
            <li>If we applied strict mode on a function it will be applied inside the function</li>
            <li>Breakpoints help us run a step-by-step run of our applications looking for errors</li>
            <li>The alert() method allows us to set breakpoints at which we can check the state of our variables</li>
            <li>Browsers also allow us to set breakpoints to analyze our applications</li>
            <li>With the 'debugger' command we can set breakpoints to analyze our code</li>
            <li>When we use the 'debugger' command we have to make sure to delete all these commands</li>
            <li>We can create errors as objects and pass them as a parameter a text that indicates the error</li>
            <li>Try, Catch, and finally are used to handle errors and allow us to clearly detect the points where we think errors may arise.</li>
