    <h1>Week 01</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>I need to buy the access code to have a premium account at Sitepoint</li>
            <li>The rest of the things I need are already included on Sitepoint or are free.</li>
            <li>I will be part of a group but I will not have to send group assignments, it is a support group.</li>
            <li>There will be office hours.</li>
            <li>My final grade will be related with my portfolio at the end of the course.</li>
            <li>I need to review how to create, define and manipulate array groups.</li>
            <li>I need to review JSON and its attributes.</li>
            <li>I should always focus on designing for mobile applications</li>
            <li>Why did the arrival of the iPhone change everything? What is special about it?</li>
            <li>The vast majority today spend more time using their mobile devices. This is an important reason why we must change our focus and develop for mobile devices first.</li>
            <li>Designing mobile-first is thinking about the future and growth.</li>
            <li>It is better to look at what others do than to listen to what they say to understand their needs when creating.</li>
            <li>Users do not want to think. When they visit the site they expect to find that everything works in a way that they are already used to.</li>
            <li>Only 9% of users stay on the page if they do not understand what they are seeing.</li>
            <li>Each device has its areas of easy medium and difficult access.</li>
            <li>Not everyone has high-speed internet. When designing we must be aware of these cases and give them attention.</li>
            <li>Mobile development is relatively new. We have to be brave to make the decisions that make the experience in this world more effective.</li>
            <li>We should always keep it simple so that users can use it simply.</li>
            <li>Not hiding the password turns out to be more effective than hiding it. It is important to provide a hiding facility if the user so wishes.</li>
            <li>Don't include Pop Ads. Users visit pages to find content, not to see advertisements.</li>
        </ul>
