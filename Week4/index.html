            <li>For forms, it is very important to use DOM.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended to use labels and inputs together.</li>
            <li>There are keywords and properties and tributes to perform validations that make our form something more solid. This is important because if we send data to the server incorrectly, we will not receive the expected response.</li>
            <li>In object-oriented programming, encapsulation is the way we keep the logic and functionality inside the object, hiding everything we don't need to see.</li>
            <li>In object-oriented programming, polymorphism allows us to combine functionalities that different objects have in common.</li>
            <li>In object-oriented programming, there can be inheritance between different objects. For example, if we have a Car object, this can inherit another Car object that, in addition to all the functionalities and properties that it has, will add some difference. Child objects inherit the properties and functionality of their parents.</li>
            <li>Static classes are called directly by the class, they do not need to be instantiated to be called.</li>
            <li>With Mixins, we can make different objects share properties and functionality without inheritance.</li>
            <li>The application of modules in Javascript allows us to keep our documents well organized and more accessible. It is a way to separate files and make them work with each other.</li>
