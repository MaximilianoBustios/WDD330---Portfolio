    <h2>Notes:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
            <li>We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions.</li>
            <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.</li>
            <li>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively.</li>
            <li>Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix. We’ll just add display: inline-block;</li>
            <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically</li>
            <li>I shouldn’t declare a new transform: because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions. We simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list.</li>
            <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.</li>
            <li>Transforms functions are applied in the order provided.</li>
            <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.</li>
            <li>I can control the origin from which my transforms are applied. This is done using the transform-origin property.</li>
            <li>The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis.</li>
            <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations. For example, if a link changes color on hover, you can have it gradually fade from one color to the other instead of a sudden change. They’re both transitions, but with the CSS transition property the color transition can be gradual.</li>
            <li>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:
                <ol>
                    <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
                    <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
                    <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>It is important to include a pre-state and a post-state.</li>
            <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.</li>
            <li>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.</li>
            <li>It’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins, whit the transition-delay property,</li>
            <li>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.</li>
            <li>A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition.</li>
            <li>With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns.</li>
            <li>All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API.</li>
            <li>With the strokeStyle or fillStyle properties we can fill our brush with color.</li>
            <li>Both strokeStyle and fillStyle are set on a context object, and both take one of three values: a string representing a color, a CanvasGradient object, or a CanvasPattern object.</li>
            <li>We can draw a rectangle calling the fillRect and strokeRect methods.</li>
            <li>Paths create a blueprint for your lines, arcs, and shapes, but paths are invisible until you give them a stroke</li>
            <li>We can also draw images onto the canvas element.</li>
        </ul>
