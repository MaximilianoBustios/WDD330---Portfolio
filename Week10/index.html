        <ul>
            <li>Built-in validation is called on everything related to validation in the HTML document</li>
            <li>With the pattern attribute, we set regular expressions as is normally done in Javascript</li>
            <li>With the pseudo-class :invalid we can highlight field errors so that the user can easily see them.</li>
            <li>The textarea element does not support the pattern attribute.</li>
            <li>The Constraint Validation API enables checking values ​​that users have entered into form controls, before submitting the values ​​to the server.</li>
            <li>The Constraint Validation API works in conjunction with the attributes we set on the client-side to validate input.</li>
            <li>When we decide not to use the built-in API, the changes we have to make to javascript are quite large. It is possible but requires more code.</li>
            <li>We must always be permissive with the input formats, if we can correct something we can do it, as long as they are not passwords.</li>
            <li>When there is an error, we must focus on that error to easily show the user what to correct.</li>
            <li>Fetch gives us a more flexible way of working with the server.</li>
            <li>The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows controlling a number of different settings.</li>
            <li>A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side</li>
            <li>When fetch() promises are resolved, different responses can be received, the most common are: Response.status, Response.statusText, and Response            </li>
        </ul>
