            <li>Javascript can convert a string to a number when it is being used in some mathematical operation. This is called type coercion.</li>
            <li>Undefined variables are those that have not been assigned a value.</li>
            <li>Null is a value ns "no value"</li>
            <li>Undefined and Null are similar but they don't mean the same</li>
            <li>When we work with Arrays we must always be aware that the references we use point to an existing value. This is to avoid storing values that are no longer needed.</li>
            <li>The sets are a structure that can only store unique values, that is, not repeated.</li>
            <li>Callback: a function that is passed as an argument to another.</li>
