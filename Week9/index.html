        <ul>
            <li>BOM helps us to access multiple features of our browser</li>
            <li>Thanks to this we can know which browser is used to view a page</li>
            <li>We can also know the dimensions of the page and the pages that were visited before and the current page.</li>
            <li>Through the window object, we can access its methods and properties.</li>
            <li>Global variables created within the program belong to the window object.</li>
            <li>parseInt() and isNaN() are global methods, so they are methods of the window object.</li>
            <li>The Navigator object contains information about the browser that is being used.</li>
            <li>The userAgent property displays information about the operating system the user is using. Although this property is still supported by all browsers, it has been deprecated.</li>
            <li>The window.location property is an object that contains the URL information of the current page.</li>
            <li>window.location.href returns the full url as a string.</li>
            <li>The hostname property returns a string that describes the domain of the current URL.</li>
            <li>window.location has the following methods:
                <ol>
                    <li>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If given a parameter of true, it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.</li>
                    <li>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example:</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>With window.history we can access information about any previously visited page from the current page.</li>
            <li>With the window.open() method you can open a new window.</li>
            <li>The close() method can be used to close a window.</li>
            <li>With window.screen we can know the dimensions in pixels of the screen. With the height and width properties, we can know the height and width.</li>
            <li>When we use document.write() this replaces the entire HTML document with the string we input into the method.</li>
            <li>We can also create and reassign cookies using document.cookie</li>
            <li>The data- attribute is a way to embed data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They are also private to a page, so they are not intended to be used by an external service; their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</li>
            <li>With the dataset property we can access the data attributes.</li>
            <li>APIs give us access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card.</li>
            <li>localStorage and sessionStorage are properties of the window object.</li>
        </ul>
